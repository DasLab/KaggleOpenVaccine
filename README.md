# DeepDeg4

Code for training and inference of mRNA molecule stability models. DeepDeg4 contains non-linear machine learning models - one based on XGBoost and a more advnced neural netwoek one based on the winning solution of the Kaggle Open Vaccine challenge. 

DeepDeg4 models are advanced versions of the original DegScore model that can be found here: https://github.com/eternagame/DegScore

## Organization of the Repository

model_files: actual model files for the models used for inference
data: data used for the modeling and inference
notebooks: inference Python notebooks
scripts: inference Python scripts

# Individual Kaggle Solutions

This code is based on the winning solution for the Open Vaccine Kaggle Competition Challenge. The competition can be found here:
